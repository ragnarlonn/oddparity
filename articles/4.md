## Background

A few years ago, I was the CEO of the online load testing service [loadimpact.com](https://loadimpact.com) and together with one of 
our angel investors I was trying to define and measure some [KPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator) metrics 
for the business (this was actually one of the more fun parts of being a CEO, because I got to do a bit of Python coding).

When we knew what to measure, and I had written the code to do the measuring, a question came up: what do we do with the data? We 
were debating whether to set up a self-hosted database server where we could store the data, to use some managed db service out there, 
to store the data in the main db for our SaaS product or perhaps just dump to a text log file. It wasn't (at that point) a lot 
of metrics or a lot of data. We even discussed running the python scripts manually and then entering the results manually into a Google spreadsheet.

At one point, the angel investor made the comment "Why isn't there some really SIMPLE, managed service where you can just send a 
numeric measurement value, and have it stored for you?". I thought "Yeah, that's a really good question. Why not?".

## Freeing up time to do it

The idea languished in my mind for a couple of years (yes, the round trip time can be long sometimes) while I was working with 
Load Impact. Recently, I quit my job at Load Impact in order to focus on personal projects. I wanted to take a stab at 
building products as a single developer. The first product (which I didn't build by myself actually - it was me and one other 
developer) was [Puzzle Pirate](https://puzzlepirate.net) - a crossword puzzle game for kids learning to read. 

After Puzzle Pirate I decided to take on this old data storage idea. To build a managed data storage service that was ridiculously 
simple. I decided to focus on [time series data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series) because that is a very common type 
of data people collect and want to store. Smart sensors typically collect time series data. As do system monitoring solutions. 
BI systems do it. Etc. I realized that a very simple solution would perhaps not appeal to all businesses out there, as many 
of them collect a ton of data in various forms, and want to do advanced analysis on that data. These are better served by going 
to one of the multiple "big data analytics" companies and buy their services. But I thought there would also be a lot of 
people with lesser needs, for whom "big data analytics product X" would be complete overkill and the slow learning curve 
you get with an advanced product would be a too big barrier to entry.

A typical use case might be people working in IoT, who are building sensor networks and need somewhere to store their sensor 
readings. They might be hobbyists, with a very limited number of sensors and no wish to use an advanced "big data" solution, 
or they might be a company that just wants to get things up and running quickly, making sure their data is stored somewhere. 
They don't have to worry about it being lost until they can figure out what to do with it. For many, I think just 
storing the data is the by far most important issue.

I looked around, but couldn't find any service that offered a super simple API to just dump your time series data points into, 
so I decided it was a valid idea for a SaaS business.

## Front-end angst

I have never been a good web developer. I stayed away from HTML/CSS/JS for 20 years, only using it when I absolutely had to. 
I could read it pretty well (except perhaps for CSS where I was really lacking in knowledge), but I couldn't really produce it. 
Instead, I got people to help me with front-end stuff, and generally tried hard to come up with solutions where front-end code 
wasn't necessary. Needless to say, it kind of limits the things you can do. The data storage project would need some web front-end 
parts, which was an issue, but help appeared suddenly when I went around discussing it with people.

I called the data storage project "Pushdata", as I found an available domain name in "pushdata.io", and when I mentioned it 
to some friends who run [Vinnovera](http://www.vinnovera.se/) - a web development consulting company - they said they might 
be able to assist with the front-end parts at no cost. They regularly took in students to do projects with them as part of 
their (the students') education. So I got professional project management help from Vinnovera, and front-end developer 
time from the students. I would just do the backend parts, which I'm of course always very happy to do.

## Goal clashes

As it turned out, the students and my goals were not completely in alignment however; they were there to learn, and 
wanted to get hands-on experience with well-known frameworks and technologies. My main goal was simply to ship a product. 

We decided to use React and Redux to build the site, and the students got to work. Fast forward a couple of months and 
we have a decent-looking site up and running with the basic functionality there. Then the student project ended and I 
had to take over the front-end. How hard could it be?  Just learn a tiny little bit of React, which can't be so tricky as 
tons of people seem to be using it, and then do the final, tiny bit of polishing needed before release.

## Diving into murky waters

As it turned out, learning React+Redux wasn't an immediate "Aha" experience. At least not for me. Part of it is 
probably that I lack a lot of basic web developer experience and -knowledge, but part of it is likely also that 
React is simply a pretty big piece of software, that can do a lot of things. I spent a couple of days reading 
React and Redux tutorials, looking at some videos etc. but didn't feel like I was on top of things after that.

I realized my lack of basic HTML/CSS/JS knowledge (particularly CSS was a bit of a black hole) needed fixing first, 
and that diving into React and Redux at the same time may have been unwise. I knew the functionality I wanted to build 
was quite limited - why not try to build it in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS?  That way I could be productive right away, and 
would learn a lot of basics along the way. I decided to make an experiment: spend a couple of days trying to replicate 
the existing React app in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, and if I made good progress I'd continue on that path. If not, I 
would have to bite the bullet and learn React properly.

As it turned out, I needed only two days to make the page render the same as it did in the React version. That 
encouraged me to spend another week on building the logic in Javascript, and when I made good progress there too 
I put in a second week and had basically the same app, but without React and Redux. The codebase shrunk from 100 
source files and 4,500 lines of code, to 3 source files and 1,000 lines of code. What was even better was that the page 
weight went from ~6MB for the compiled React app, to ~400kB for my vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, which meant much faster load 
and render times on slow connections.

And I knew the code base inside and out. That's a big plus.

I felt my productivity on the front-end side increase a lot after these two weeks, but then came the next 
disappointment, which should not have been a surprise really: the devil's in the details.

That is, whether
