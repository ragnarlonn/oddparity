Amazon is on track to be the highest-valued company on earth (if they're not already), and Jeff Bezos just divorced, losing half his ownership, which makes him and his wife take third and fourth place on the richest people on earth-list. Pretty amazing.

A lot has been written about Amazon and why they're so successful, and while I follow them closely I am not an expert on the inner workings of the company. Bezos, however, attributes most of the success to the customer-obsessed company culture, and that resonates with me. I wanted to write a short text on why I believe Jeff Bezos is on to something here, and that customer obsession is the most important growth factor in any company.

I have founded multiple startups and seen both failure and success, so I probably have some gut feeling for things that work in a startup and what doesn't, but my data set is of course very small. Take this for what it's worth.

Here's a Bezos quote to start things off:

Your desire to delight customers will drive you to invent on their behalf.

And a quick note: "invent" doesn't mean just technical/product inventing. It means any kind of novel way of doing things that would benefit the customer.

I think many people working in companies that aren't truly customer obsessed will go "yeah, that's us. We do that". The company may have a policy or a mission statement saying they should "strive to delight customers", or something along those lines, and that makes people think they're customer obsessive.

But a policy, or a rule, is *not* culture. Culture is what you do, how you act. It's the personality of the organisation. People in the organisation don't have to think much about how they should behave, they just do it automatically if it is part of the company culture. Conversely, if it's not part of the company culture, a behaviour/trait you want can be very hard indeed to get people to adhere to.

So many believe they are customer focused (or customer "obsessed"), but few actually are. I had an argument a while back with people in a SaaS company about refund policy. They thought it was fair to keep a monthly subscription fee for a SaaS product that the customer forgot to cancel, even though the customer was never going to use the product during the last month. I thought it was just being customer-centric to refund a customer who got no value from the purchase. I failed to convince the company, however, and in the end they still thought it was better to go for the small, quick buck, at the longer-term expense of a less satisfied customer. They were not truly customer focused/obsessed.

By not refunding, they managed to keep an extra couple of hundred dollars that was the monthly subscription fee. Had they refunded the money, however, they would have got a happy customer. Happy customers are known to:

- Come back and buy again: Just the higher lifetime value you get from a "happy" customer vs an "not so happy" customer is probably worth more than that single monthly fee.

- Evangelize the product and the company: Free marketing of the best kind. Can be worth any amount of money.

These things make a business *grow*

Happy customers make a business *grow*

Happy customers is the result of a great customer experience

*Unhappy* customers, on the other hand, can also act as ambassadors, but in a negative way.

In my mind, being customer focused is working for the longer term, and working for the longer term is the only thing that really drives the *growth* of a business.

Now, if you're not customer obsessed when setting your refund policy, you're probably not going to be customer obsessed when building your product either. Because you don't *really* care about the customer, do you? You're especially not going to fret over things like how to make canceling a subscription easier, because making that simpler seems obvious that it would *reduce* revenue, not increase it.

All taken together, this creates a mindset and a culture that makes it less likely that you'll find real success. Superficially, the decision to make it harder for customers to leave, or the decision to fleece them for an extra months' subscription fee, seems to make sense as it provides obvious and immediate business benefits. If you look deeper,
however, this always comes at a cost. I believe this cost is much greater than many people who like to think of themselves as "business-savvy" realise.

Perhaps the failure to see that the long term cost isn't worth the short term gains is because of a lack of imagination and/or analytical ability. It could also be an unwillingness to take into account anything that isn't easily quantifiable, and long-term effects are usually much, much harder to quantify than short-term ones.

And you can't pick and choose when to adopt a certain cultural trait. You're either it, or you're not. If you want to be truly customer obsessed, and reap the potentially pretty big long term benefits, you have to go all in. Anything less and your organisation will not *believe* and lack of belief means they won't adopt, which means you won't get the trait even when you want it to be there.
