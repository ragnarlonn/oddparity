Amazon is on track to be the highest-valued company on earth (if they're not already), and Jeff Bezos just divorced, losing half his ownership, which makes him and his wife take third and fourth place on the richest people on earth-list. Pretty amazing.

A lot has been written about Amazon and why they're so successful, and while I follow them closely I am not an expert in the inner workings of the company. Bezos, however, attributes most of the success to the customer-obsessed company culture, and that resonates with me. I wanted to write a short text on why I believe Jeff Bezos is right, and that customer obsession is the most important growth factor in any company.

I have founded multiple startups and seen both failure and success, so I probably have some gut feeling for things that work in a startup and what doesn't, but my data set is still small so I might get any single thing wrong if I tried to focus on just one thing.
