## Background

Like most people with a smartphone, I'm producing a lot of picture and video material continuously; especially pictures and 
videos of the kids in various situations, but lots of other things too. These are, of course, a digital legacy that I don't 
want to lose.

Unlike most people perhaps, I'm not happy with just sending all that data to some large, corporate giant somewhere and trust 
them to keep it safe for me. They could be hacked, they could be staffed with incompetent or uninterested staff that botch 
things and lose my data. Losing the data is the worst scenario, but another potential bad outcome is privacy violations as 
the corporation is forced by some authority somewhere to give up my data to them, and then who knows what will happen to it.

So - I want a solution that:

- allows me to store my data in multiple physical locations that I choose
- allows me to store data encrypted, when I don't trust the maintainers of the storage infrastructure
- allows me to store the data unencrypted (for convenience reasons), when I do trust the infrastructure maintainers
- backs up data automatically, so I don't have to remember to do it. This means it should be possible to find
  software for several different platforms (in my case, mostly Android and MacOS) that can perform the backups 
  automatically

There are lots of solutions out there, but none that I could find that offer all these things in one package. So I decided to 
create my own.
