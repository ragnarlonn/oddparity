# Odd Parity

Odd Parity is a company that builds products. We follow the Personal Pain Point Principle, which means that all the things we build are things we have wanted or needed ourselves, at some point. If we're 100% sure we solve a problem for at least *one* person, chances are there are more people out there with the same issue. Any released projects will be written about here, and we release _all_ projects!
